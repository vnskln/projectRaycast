# Project Raycast

What is it?
- Java/JavaFx
- 2,5d raycasting game engine (based on Wolfenstein 3D engine)
- left part of screen is a map with player position and field of view
- right part of screen is pseudo 3D view
- basic collision detection
- stiff fps based on systemTimeNano
- hardcoded player speed and rotation speed
- engine logic based on C++ tutorial by Lode Vandevenne (https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)

- player speed and rotation speed based on system time
- adding sprites
